# Sonar Mines vs Rocks project
This short report demonstrate a systematic process for working through classification Predictive Modeling problems that delivers above average results in Python


The following is a 5-Step Systematic Process used:

1-Define the Problem

2-Prepare Data

3-Spot Check Algorithms

4-Improve Results

5-Present Results


1-Problem Definition

The focus of this project will be the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset. The problem is to predict metal or rock objects from sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder). The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.
